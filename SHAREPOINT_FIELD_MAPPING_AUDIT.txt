COMPREHENSIVE SHAREPOINT FIELD MAPPING AUDIT REPORT
Date: December 20, 2025
Application: School Business Continuity Management System
================================================================================

This audit examines all SharePoint field mappings used in the application by 
comparing actual model definitions, transformation functions, and component 
references.

================================================================================
1. SBC_DRILLS_LOG
================================================================================

LIST STRUCTURE:
  - ID (system field)
  - Title (single line text)
  - SchoolName_Ref (lookup to SchoolInfo list)
  - DrillHypothesis (choice field)
  - SpecificEvent (multi-line text)
  - TargetGroup (choice field)
  - ExecutionDate (date field)
  - ComplianceAssetId (system field)
  - Created, Modified (system fields)
  - Author, Editor (person fields)

MODEL COLUMNS (from SBC_Drills_LogModel.ts):
  ID, Title, SchoolName_Ref, SchoolName_Ref#Id, DrillHypothesis, DrillHypothesis#Id,
  SpecificEvent, TargetGroup, TargetGroup#Id, ExecutionDate, OData__ColorTag,
  ComplianceAssetId, Modified, Created, Author, Editor, {Identifier}, {IsFolder},
  {Thumbnail}, {Link}, {Name}, {FilenameWithExtension}, {Path}, {FullPath},
  {ModerationStatus}, {ModerationComment}, {ContentType}, {HasAttachments},
  {Attachments}, {VersionNumber}, {TriggerWindowStartToken}, {TriggerWindowEndToken}

CODE REFERENCES (sharepointService.ts):
  - Interface Drill uses: Title, SchoolName_Ref, DrillHypothesis, SpecificEvent,
    TargetGroup, ExecutionDate, and additional computed fields (IsAdminPlan, 
    StartDate, EndDate, PlanStatus, Quarter, Responsible, Notes, AcademicYear,
    PlanEffectivenessRating, ProceduresEffectivenessRating, SchoolFeedback,
    ImprovementSuggestions)
  - recordDrillExecution() writes to: Title, ExecutionDate, SchoolName

ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
  ✓ Core fields are properly mapped
  ⚠ COMPUTED FIELDS NOT IN SHAREPOINT: IsAdminPlan, StartDate, EndDate, 
    PlanStatus, Quarter, Responsible, Notes, AcademicYear, 
    PlanEffectivenessRating, ProceduresEffectivenessRating, SchoolFeedback,
    ImprovementSuggestions - these are mentioned in the Drill interface but NOT
    in the SharePoint model. They appear to be intended for future use or are
    incorrectly documented.

================================================================================
2. BC_TEST_PLANS
================================================================================

LIST STRUCTURE:
  - ID (system field)
  - Title (single line text)
  - field_1 to field_10 (generic field names in SharePoint)
  - field_6 (appears to be choice field based on field_6Value interface)

MODEL COLUMNS (from BC_Test_PlansModel.ts):
  ID, Title, field_1, field_2, field_3, field_4, field_5, field_6, field_7,
  field_8, field_9, field_10, OData__ColorTag, ComplianceAssetId, Modified,
  Created, Author, Editor, {system fields}

CODE REFERENCES (adminDataService.ts):
  - Interface TestPlan maps:
    * Title -> title
    * field_1 -> hypothesis
    * field_2 -> specificEvent
    * field_3 -> targetGroup
    * field_4 -> startDate
    * field_5 -> endDate
    * field_6 -> status (choice field)
    * field_7 -> responsible
    * field_8 -> notes
  - getDrillsForSchool() loads all BC_Test_Plans and transforms via 
    transformTestPlan()
  - Drills.tsx attempts to load Status options via:
    BC_Test_PlansService.getReferencedEntity('', 'field_6')

ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
  ⚠ GENERIC FIELD NAMES: SharePoint uses generic "field_X" names instead of
    descriptive column names. This makes maintenance difficult and error-prone.
  ✓ Transformation function properly maps field_X to business logic properties
  ✓ field_6 correctly identified as choice field with dynamic loading

================================================================================
3. SBC_INCIDENTS_LOG
================================================================================

LIST STRUCTURE:
  - ID (system field)
  - Title (single line text)
  - SchoolName_Ref (lookup)
  - IncidentCategory (choice field)
  - ActivatedAlternative (choice field)
  - RiskLevel (choice field)
  - ActivationTime (date/time field)
  - AlertModelType (choice field)
  - HazardDescription (multi-line text)
  - CoordinatedEntities (choice field)
  - IncidentNumber (number field)
  - ActionTaken (choice field)
  - AltLocation (choice field)
  - CommunicationDone (boolean/yes-no field)
  - ClosureTime (date/time field)
  - Challenges (multi-line text)
  - LessonsLearned (multi-line text)
  - Suggestions (multi-line text)

MODEL COLUMNS (from SBC_Incidents_LogModel.ts):
  ID, Title, SchoolName_Ref, IncidentCategory, ActivatedAlternative,
  RiskLevel, ActivationTime, AlertModelType, HazardDescription,
  CoordinatedEntities, IncidentNumber, ActionTaken, AltLocation,
  CommunicationDone, ClosureTime, Challenges, LessonsLearned, Suggestions,
  {system fields}

CODE REFERENCES (sharepointService.ts):
  - Interface Incident uses all core fields listed above
  - Incidents.tsx loads dropdown options dynamically from SharePoint using:
    SBC_Incidents_LogService.getReferencedEntity('', 'IncidentCategory')
    SBC_Incidents_LogService.getReferencedEntity('', 'RiskLevel')
    SBC_Incidents_LogService.getReferencedEntity('', 'AlertModelType')
    SBC_Incidents_LogService.getReferencedEntity('', 'ActivatedAlternative')
    SBC_Incidents_LogService.getReferencedEntity('', 'CoordinatedEntities')
    SBC_Incidents_LogService.getReferencedEntity('', 'ActionTaken')
    SBC_Incidents_LogService.getReferencedEntity('', 'AltLocation')

ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
  ✓ All choice fields are properly named and referenced
  ✓ Dynamic loading of dropdown options ensures compliance
  ✓ Field structure matches interface requirements
  ⚠ COMPUTED FIELDS IN CODE: Incident interface includes calculated fields
    (ResponseTimeMinutes, RecoveryTimeHours, ResponseRating, CoordinationRating,
    CommunicationRating, RecoveryRating, OverallRating, EvaluationNotes,
    IsEvaluated) that are NOT in SharePoint model - these are computed in
    calculateIncidentEvaluation() function

================================================================================
4. BC_INCIDENT_EVALUATIONS
================================================================================

LIST STRUCTURE:
  - ID (system field)
  - Title (single line text)
  - field_2 to field_15 (generic field names)
  - IncidentNumber (lookup)
  - Incident_Ref (lookup)
  - ResponseTimeMinutes (number field)
  - RecoveryTimeHours (number field)
  - StudentsReturnedDate (date field)
  - AlternativeUsed (multi-line text)

MODEL COLUMNS (from BC_Incident_EvaluationsModel.ts):
  ID, Title, field_2, field_3, field_4, field_5, field_6, field_7, field_8,
  field_9, field_10, field_11, field_12, field_13, field_14, field_15,
  IncidentNumber, Incident_Ref, ResponseTimeMinutes, RecoveryTimeHours,
  StudentsReturnedDate, AlternativeUsed, {system fields}

CODE REFERENCES (adminDataService.ts):
  - Interface IncidentEvaluation maps:
    * ID -> id
    * field_1 -> incidentId (NOTE: field_1 NOT in model, uses 
      IncidentNumber instead)
    * field_2 -> evaluationDate
    * field_3 -> evaluatedBy
    * field_4 -> overallScore / responseEffectiveness
    * field_5 -> strengths / communicationEffectiveness
    * field_6 -> weaknesses / coordinationEffectiveness
    * field_7 -> recommendations / timelinessScore
    * field_8 -> responseTimeMinutes
    * field_9 -> recoveryTimeHours
    * field_10 -> studentsReturnedDate
    * field_11 -> alternativeUsed
    * field_12 -> lessonsLearned
    * field_13 -> followUpRequired
    * field_14 -> followUpDate
    * field_15 -> notes

ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
  ✗ CRITICAL: transformIncidentEvaluation() tries to read field_1 but this
    column is NOT defined in BC_Incident_EvaluationsModel.ts. Instead, the
    model has IncidentNumber and Incident_Ref lookups. Code should use:
    raw.IncidentNumber or raw.Incident_Ref instead of raw.field_1
  ⚠ GENERIC FIELD NAMES: SharePoint uses field_X naming which obscures purpose
  ⚠ FIELD MAPPING MISMATCH: Code comments show dual mapping (e.g., field_4
    maps to both overallScore AND responseEffectiveness) indicating schema
    confusion

================================================================================
5. SCHOOL_TRAINING_LOG
================================================================================

LIST STRUCTURE:
  - ID (system field)
  - Title (single line text)
  - SchoolName_Ref (lookup)
  - Program_Ref (lookup)
  - RegistrationType (choice field)
  - AttendeesNames (multi-select person/lookup field)
  - TrainingDate (date field)

MODEL COLUMNS (from School_Training_LogModel.ts):
  ID, Title, SchoolName_Ref, Program_Ref, RegistrationType, AttendeesNames,
  TrainingDate, {system fields}

CODE REFERENCES (sharepointService.ts):
  - Interface TrainingLog maps:
    * Title -> title
    * Program_Ref -> program
    * SchoolName_Ref -> schoolName_Ref
    * RegistrationType -> registrationType
    * AttendeesNames -> attendeesNames
    * TrainingDate -> trainingDate

ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
  ✓ All core fields are properly mapped
  ✓ Field names match between model and interface
  ✓ Lookup relationships are correctly defined

================================================================================

  - field_4 (number - sort order)
  - PlanRef (lookup to BC_Shared_Plan)

MODEL COLUMNS (from BC_Plan_ScenariosModel.ts):
  ID, Title, field_1, field_2, field_3, field_4, PlanRef, {system fields}

CODE REFERENCES (adminDataService.ts):
  - Interface PlanScenario maps:
    * Title -> title
    * field_2 -> description
    * field_3 -> actions (split by newline)
    * field_1 -> scenarioNumber
    * field_4 -> sortOrder
    * PlanRef -> planRef (not used in create, only read)

ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
  ⚠ GENERIC FIELD NAMES: field_1, field_2, field_3, field_4 are not 
    descriptive
  ✓ Actions stored as multi-line text and split properly
  ✓ Mapping is consistent between code and model

================================================================================
7. BC_ADMIN_CONTACTS
================================================================================

LIST STRUCTURE:
  - ID (system field)
  - Title (single line text - name)
  - field_1 to field_10 (generic field names)
    * field_1 (choice - role)
    * field_2 (number - phone)
    * field_3 (single line text - email)
    * field_4 to field_8 (choice fields - organization/category)
    * field_9 (multi-line text - notes)
    * field_10 (yes/no - visibility/active status)

MODEL COLUMNS (from BC_Admin_ContactsModel.ts):
  ID, Title, field_1, field_2, field_3, field_4, field_5, field_6, field_7,

    * field_8 -> backupMember (choice)
    * field_9 -> notes
    * field_10 -> isVisibleToSchools / isActive (yes/no)

ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
  ⚠ GENERIC FIELD NAMES: All custom fields use field_X naming
  ✓ Phone field correctly converted to number type
  ✓ Choice fields properly wrapped in arrays for creation/update
  ✓ Dual use of field_10 (both isVisibleToSchools and isActive) could cause
    confusion in code - AdminPanel.tsx uses it as isVisibleToSchools toggle

================================================================================
8. BC_SHARED_PLAN
================================================================================

LIST STRUCTURE:
  - ID (system field)
  - Title (single line text)
  - field_1 to field_9 (generic field names)
  - FileUploadDate (date field)
  - Task1_1_Complete to Task1_4_Complete (yes/no fields)

    * Task1_2_Complete -> task1_2_complete
    * Task1_3_Complete -> task1_3_complete
    * Task1_4_Complete -> task1_4_complete

ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
  ⚠ GENERIC FIELD NAMES: field_1 through field_8 obscure purpose
  ⚠ UNUSED FIELD: field_9 is not mapped or used anywhere
  ✓ Named fields (FileUploadDate, Task1_X_Complete) are properly named and used
  ✓ Mapping includes both field_X and named columns

================================================================================
9. BC_DR_CHECKLIST
================================================================================

LIST STRUCTURE:
  - ID (system field)
  - Title (single line text)
  - field_1 (choice - category)
  - field_2 (choice - status: ready/partial/not_ready)
  - field_3 (date field - lastChecked)
  - field_4 (choice - priority)
  - field_5 (single line text - responsible person)
  - field_6 (number - or part of mapping confusion)

MODEL COLUMNS (from BC_DR_ChecklistModel.ts):
  ID, Title, field_1, field_2, field_3, field_4, field_5, field_6, {system fields}

CODE REFERENCES (adminDataService.ts):
  - Interface DRCheckItem maps:
    * ID -> id
    * Title -> title
    * field_1 -> category (choice)
    * field_2 -> status (choice)
    * field_3 -> lastChecked (date)
    * field_4 -> notes AND priority (DUAL MAPPING ISSUE)
    * field_5 -> responsiblePerson
    * field_6 -> notes / priority (CONFUSION)

ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
  ✗ CRITICAL: transformDRCheckItem() has inconsistent field mapping:
    - notes: raw.field_4 || raw.field_6 || '' (tries two different fields)
    - priority: raw.field_4 || '' (same as notes)
    This indicates either missing field definition or schema mismatch
  ⚠ MODEL DEFINITION INCOMPLETE: Model only defines field_1 through field_6
    but transformDRCheckItem references raw.SortOrder, raw.CheckedBy,
    raw.Priority, raw.ResponsiblePerson which are NOT in the model
  ⚠ GENERIC FIELD NAMES make the mapping unclear

================================================================================
10. BC_DAMAGE_REPORTS
================================================================================

    * field_6 -> recoveryTime
    * field_7 -> status (choice)
    * field_8 -> notes
    * field_9 -> reportedBy
    * field_10 -> incidentRef (NOTE: should use Incident_Ref from model)

ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
  ⚠ GENERIC FIELD NAMES: field_1 through field_9 (and more up to field_17)
  ⚠ MODEL/CODE MISMATCH: Code uses field_1 for date but model starts at field_2.
    This suggests field_1 might be in SharePoint but missing from generated model
  ✓ Named lookup fields (IncidentNumber, School_Ref, Incident_Ref) are properly
    defined in model
  ⚠ CHOICE FIELDS: field_2, field_3, field_4 should wrap values in array format
    for creation but mapping shows direct choice references

================================================================================
11. BC_PLAN_DOCUMENTS
================================================================================

LIST STRUCTURE:
  - ID (system field)
  - Title (single line text)
  - field_1 (choice - document type)
  - field_2 to field_8 (generic field names)

MODEL COLUMNS (from BC_Plan_DocumentsModel.ts):

================================================================================
12. BC_PLAN_REVIEW
================================================================================

LIST STRUCTURE:
  - ID (system field)
  - Title (single line text)
  - field_1 to field_19 (generic field names)
  - Plan_Ref (lookup)
  - Task7_1_Complete to Task7_3_Complete (yes/no fields)

    * field_16 -> task7_2_complete
    * field_17 -> task7_3_complete
    * field_18 -> reviewedBy
    * field_19 -> reviewerRole
    (Also reads named fields: ReviewFileName, ReviewFileUploadDate, etc.)

ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
  ⚠ DUPLICATE FIELD DEFINITIONS: SharePoint has BOTH generic field_X AND named
    columns (ReviewFileName, ReviewFileUploadDate, ResponseScenario1-5, etc.).
    Code reads from both, creating confusion about which is authoritative.
  ⚠ GENERIC FIELD NAMES: field_1 through field_19 are used alongside named
    columns, making the schema confusing
  ✓ Mapping is complete but overly complex due to dual naming scheme

================================================================================
13. BC_TEAMS_MEMBERS
================================================================================

LIST STRUCTURE:
  - ID (system field)
  - Title (single line text - name)
  - SchoolName_Ref (lookup)
  - JobRole (choice field)
  - MembershipType (choice field)
  - Mobile (number field)
  - MemberEmail (single line text - email)

MODEL COLUMNS (from BC_Teams_MembersModel.ts):
  ID, Title, SchoolName_Ref, JobRole, MembershipType, Mobile, MemberEmail,
  {system fields}

CODE REFERENCES (sharepointService.ts):
  - Interface TeamMember maps:
    * ID -> id
    * Title -> title
    * SchoolName_Ref -> schoolName_Ref
    * JobRole -> jobRole
    * MembershipType -> membershipType
    * Mobile -> memberMobile (note: property name is different)
    * MemberEmail -> memberEmail

ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
  ✓ Field names are descriptive and properly named
  ⚠ PROPERTY NAME MISMATCH: SharePoint field is "Mobile" but interface uses
    "MemberMobile" in the TeamMember export interface
  ✓ Lookup relationships properly defined
  ✓ Choice fields properly identified

================================================================================
14. BC_MUTUAL_OPERATION
================================================================================

LIST STRUCTURE:
  - ID (system field)
  - Title (single line text)
  - field_5 to field_18 (generic field names)
  - SourceSchoolID (lookup)
  - SourceSchoolName (lookup)
  - AlternativeSchoolID (lookup)
  - AlternativeSchoolName (lookup)
  - Capacity (number field)
  - SupportingGrades (single line text)

MODEL COLUMNS (from BC_Mutual_OperationModel.ts):
  ID, Title, field_5, field_6, field_10, field_11, field_12, field_13, field_14,
  field_15, field_16, field_17, field_18, SourceSchoolID, SourceSchoolName,
  AlternativeSchoolID, AlternativeSchoolName, Capacity, SupportingGrades,
  {system fields}

CODE REFERENCES (adminDataService.ts):
  - Interface MutualOperation maps:
    * SourceSchoolName -> sourceSchool
    * AlternativeSchoolName -> school
    * field_3 -> address (BUT field_3 NOT in model)
    * Distance -> distance (BUT NOT in model)
    * field_5 -> transport
    * field_6 -> activationPriority
    * field_7 to field_12 -> various contact/agreement fields
    (Also reads from Title for transport field)

ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
  ✗ CRITICAL: transformMutualOperation() maps field_1, field_2, field_3, field_4
    but model shows NO field_1 through field_4. The actual model has field_5
    onward. This is a major mismatch.
  ✗ CRITICAL: References to Distance, AlternativeAddress are NOT in the model
    but are used in the transformation
  ⚠ SKIPPED FIELD NAMES: Model jumps from Title directly to field_5,
    suggesting field_1-4 are missing from generated model or incorrectly generated
  ⚠ GENERIC FIELD NAMES: Multiple generic field names mixed with named lookups

================================================================================
SUMMARY OF CRITICAL ISSUES
================================================================================

1. BC_INCIDENT_EVALUATIONS
   Issue: transformIncidentEvaluation() reads field_1 which is not defined in
          the model. Uses IncidentNumber instead.
   Impact: Data read/write may fail
   Recommendation: Update code to use IncidentNumber or Incident_Ref

2. BC_DR_CHECKLIST
   Issue: Dual field mapping (field_4/field_6 for notes and priority) with
          references to undefined fields (SortOrder, CheckedBy, Priority)
   Impact: Data mapping ambiguous and error-prone
   Recommendation: Clarify schema definition and consolidate field references

3. BC_DAMAGE_REPORTS
   Issue: Code reads from field_1 for date but model starts at field_2.
          References to field_10 for incidentRef should use Incident_Ref
   Impact: Potential field misalignment in data reads/writes
   Recommendation: Verify field numbering matches actual SharePoint schema

4. BC_MUTUAL_OPERATION
   Issue: Critical - transformMutualOperation() maps field_1 through field_4
          which don't exist in model. Model shows field_5 onward. References
          to Distance and AlternativeAddress fields that aren't in model.
   Impact: Data transformation will fail
   Recommendation: Regenerate model from SharePoint schema or fix transformation

5. BC_PLAN_REVIEW
   Issue: Dual column naming system (field_X AND named columns) creates confusion
          about which is authoritative
   Impact: Maintenance complexity and potential data consistency issues
   Recommendation: Consolidate to single naming scheme

6. GENERIC FIELD NAMES THROUGHOUT
   Issue: Most lists use field_X naming instead of descriptive column names
   Impact: Difficult to understand schema without documentation
   Recommendation: Rename SharePoint columns to descriptive names and regenerate
                   models

7. UNIMPLEMENTED FIELDS
   Issue: SBC_Drills_Log interface includes fields not in SharePoint model
          (IsAdminPlan, StartDate, EndDate, PlanStatus, Quarter, Responsible,
          Notes, AcademicYear, PlanEffectivenessRating, 
          ProceduresEffectivenessRating, SchoolFeedback, ImprovementSuggestions)
   Impact: Code references fields that don't exist in SharePoint
   Recommendation: Add these columns to SharePoint list or remove from interface

================================================================================
SUMMARY OF WARNINGS
================================================================================

1. BC_TEST_PLANS (field_6 Status)
   - Dynamic loading implemented correctly but field name is generic
   - Recommendation: Verify field_6 actually contains Status choices

2. BC_SHARED_PLAN (field_9)
   - Field is defined in model but never used in code
   - Recommendation: Either use or remove this field

3. Mobile vs MemberMobile
   - SharePoint column: Mobile
   - Code uses: MemberMobile
   - Not critical but inconsistent naming

4. Computed vs Stored Fields
   - Multiple interfaces include computed fields that are calculated at runtime
   - Ensures data integrity but adds complexity
   - Review: IncidentEvaluation (rating fields), Drill (effectiveness ratings)

5. Choice Field Wrapping
   - Some code wraps choice values in [{Value: ...}] arrays for creation
   - Others treat as plain strings
   - Recommendation: Standardize choice field handling

================================================================================
SUMMARY OF WORKING MAPPINGS
================================================================================

These lists have correct, consistent field mappings:

✓ SBC_DRILLS_LOG - All core fields properly mapped (except unimplemented extras)
✓ SBC_INCIDENTS_LOG - All fields properly named and referenced
✓ SCHOOL_TRAINING_LOG - All fields properly named and mapped
✓ BC_PLAN_SCENARIOS - Field mapping is consistent
✓ BC_ADMIN_CONTACTS - Proper handling of choice and number fields
✓ BC_PLAN_DOCUMENTS - Complete and consistent mapping
✓ BC_TEAMS_MEMBERS - Descriptive field names (except Mobile/MemberMobile alias)

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE (HIGH PRIORITY):
1. Fix BC_MUTUAL_OPERATION transformation - model and code are misaligned
2. Fix BC_INCIDENT_EVALUATIONS field_1 reference
3. Fix BC_DR_CHECKLIST dual field mapping
4. Verify BC_DAMAGE_REPORTS field numbering

SHORT TERM (MEDIUM PRIORITY):
1. Rename generic field_X columns in SharePoint to descriptive names
2. Regenerate models after column renames
